hi lovee..
 Exams are frying your brain huh?? First, pause n breathe... 
 I'm sure you have a solid study plan and u prolly are a bit behind tryna catch up to it or the subject is jus shitty all over.. But whatever the scenario is, remember you have done this before.. You have aced many exams like this before and you will do it again...
  It's amazing that you are managing all this together (I still have no idea how u do this) (u r even gooooodd in it like??!!! peak>>)
  Ik the syllabus left to cover looks sooo overwhelming, but lets jus do it one by one alr... jus start with one topic.. u will reach ur flow state... 
  Don't let this stress ruin your appetite and sleep alr??!!!! eat well bishh!!!! u need all that energy to store everything in ur brain... gv ur head good rest too!!!! 
You also hv this habit of closing off when things get stressy, you dont like half-assin convos with us right? My sweet girllll we will understand it... We all love and care about you.. so dont go soo hard on urself.. 
i believe in youuuuuuu... u can do it!!! ace it!! 
i love youuu🪄🪄
