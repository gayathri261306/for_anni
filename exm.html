Hi loveee,
Exams are frying your brain, huh?? First, pause and breathe…
I’m sure you have a solid study plan and you’re probably a bit behind trying to catch up to it, or the subject is just shitty all over. But whatever the scenario is, remember — you’ve done this before. You’ve aced many exams like this before, and you will do it again.
It’s amazing that you’re managing all this together (I still have no idea how you do this). You’re even goooood at it, like??!!! Peak>>>
I know the syllabus left to cover looks sooo overwhelming, but let’s just do it one by one, alright? Just start with one topic. You’ll reach your flow state.
Don’t let this stress ruin your appetite and sleep, okay??!!!! Eat well, bishhh!!!! You need all that energy to store everything in your brain. Give your head good rest too!!!!
You also have this habit of closing off when things get stressful — you don’t like half-assing convos with us, right? My sweet girllll, we will understand. We all love and care about you. So don’t go so hard on yourself.

I believe in youuuuuu. You can do it!!! Ace it!!
I love youuu 🪄🪄
