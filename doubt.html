Ohooo okay, so you’re doubting yourself, huh???
I don’t know what it is that you’re doubting yourself about right now… If you think you can’t do something??? LOL. You are sooo wrong, ma’am... My girl can do anything she puts her mind to. I know that. I’m so sure of that.
See, it’s okay to doubt yourself. It might go well or it might flop, but what’s important is that you give your best to it, right?
Remember, you have done everything you’ve put your mind to — whether it’s studying Russian, going for your master’s, or preparing for UPSC. You’ve given your best to everything that truly matters to you.
So whatever it is that you want to do right now, you’ll be able to do that tooooo. So stop doubting yourself and just go for it!!!
